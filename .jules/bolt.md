## 2025-02-18 - Lazy Loading Config
**Learning:** Instantiating `Config` was consuming ~30-70ms due to `import yaml` and file I/O, even for commands that didn't need it (like `init` or `help`).
**Action:** Implemented lazy loading in `Config` class. `_config` is initialized to `None` and loaded only on first access to properties. This reduces startup time for simple commands and defers the cost for others.

## 2025-02-18 - Caching Jinja2 Environment
**Learning:** Instantiating Jinja2 Environment is surprisingly expensive (35ms vs 0.7ms) even with FileSystemLoader, likely due to filter registration and internal setup.
**Action:** Cache Environment instances at class level when template directory is constant or keys are manageable.

## 2024-05-22 - Lazy Imports for CLI Performance
**Learning:** Top-level imports of heavy libraries (like Jinja2) in a CLI entry point slow down all commands, even those that don't use the library (like `--help`).
**Action:** Move heavy imports inside the specific command functions where they are used.

## 2025-02-18 - Regex Pre-compilation in Hot Paths
**Learning:** Re-compiling regexes inside a frequently called function (like `latex_escape` which runs for every string) creates significant overhead. Pre-compiling them at module level yielded a ~3.2x speedup.
**Action:** Always look for regex compilations inside loops or frequently called functions and move them to module level constants.

## 2024-05-22 - FastApi Event Loop Starvation
**Learning:** Blocking synchronous I/O operations (like reading files or heavy processing like PDF compilation) inside FastAPI async routes block the main thread and cause event loop starvation, leading to performance degradation and unresponsiveness under load.
**Action:** Always wrap synchronous and blocking I/O calls inside async routes using `await anyio.to_thread.run_sync()`. For functions with keyword arguments, use `functools.partial()` to wrap the call.
