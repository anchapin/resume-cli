## 2025-02-12 - [Critical] API Authentication Fail-Open Default
**Vulnerability:** The API authentication mechanism (`api/auth.py`) defaulted to allowing access if the `RESUME_API_KEY` environment variable was not set ("dev mode"). Additionally, it used a timing-vulnerable string comparison for the API key check.
**Learning:** "Dev mode" defaults that bypass security controls are dangerous because they can easily be deployed to production by accident, leaving the system wide open.
**Prevention:** Implement a "fail-closed" strategy. If a security configuration (like an API key) is missing, the application should refuse to start or deny all requests, rather than failing open. Always use `secrets.compare_digest` for sensitive string comparisons.
